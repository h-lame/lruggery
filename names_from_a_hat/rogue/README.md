El Rogue
--------

A rogue-like dungeon generator for randomizing the order of some speakers for lightning talks at the February 2012 LRUG meeting.

Features:

 * No tests!
 * Chunky ASCII fonts
 * Shoddy puts-based terminal output
 * Apparently "weird" WASD controls
 * Strange abstractions
 * Probably broken randomizer (rogue/spreader)
 * Pretty dungeons
